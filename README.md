# SliceMaster – Mern Pizza App
A secure, scalable Node.js backend for pizza ordering – with JWT auth and email support.

SliceMaster is a full-stack pizza ordering and delivery web application built using the MERN stack: MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. The project features a fully functional RESTful API, secure user authentication, and a responsive frontend interface, providing users with a smooth experience from browsing the menu to placing and tracking their orders.

## Features

This application allows users to browse a menu of available pizzas, add items to a shopping cart, and place orders. User registration and login are implemented with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to ensure secure authentication. An admin interface is also included, allowing management of pizzas and orders. The frontend is responsive, ensuring usability on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Tech Stack

The backend is developed using Node.js and Express.js, with MongoDB as the database and Mongoose for data modeling. The frontend is built with React and communicates with the backend using Axios. The application uses JWT for secure authentication and dotenv for managing environment variables. Postman was used during development for testing the API endpoints.


## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main folders: client for the React frontend and server for the Express backend. The backend contains models, routes, and controllers to handle business logic, while the frontend includes components and pages for the user interface.

## License

This project is open-source and available for use and modification.
